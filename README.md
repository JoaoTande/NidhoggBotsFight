*
* ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
* This code is a hack for the game Nidhogg. With this code is possible
* construct two different bots in order to control the avatars during
* the game and make them fight.
*
* HOW TO USE IT.
* You can build your own bot inside of the function ActionThead() of 
* playerone or playertwo. You also can create others player classes 
* by creating a character's son class. After that you just need to 
* set your players in the main() function using a1.setPlayerYellow();
* and a1.setPlayerOrange();.
